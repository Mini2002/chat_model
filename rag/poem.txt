Across the ink-black ocean high,
Stars are blossoms in the sky,
Sewn by hands of cosmic art,
Each a furnace, each a heart.

Whispers drift on midnight air,
Tales of galaxies laid bare,
Ancient fires that never tire,
Burning with a quiet desire.

They watched the Earth’s first ocean tide,
Kingdoms fall and kings with pride,
Every wish and every fear,
Lost and found, now crystal clear.

Guiding sailors through the dark,
Lighting up a lover’s spark,
Hidden maps in scattered light,
Codes that only shine at night.

Though we wander far below,
Stars remind us: dream and glow.
